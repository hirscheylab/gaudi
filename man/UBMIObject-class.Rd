\title{UBMIObject Class}
\description{
A class representing the output of the UMAP-based Multi-omics Integration (UBMI) method.
The \code{UBMIObject} class encapsulates various results and metadata from the UBMI analysis,
including integrated factors, clustering results, silhouette scores, and metagene associations.
}
\details{
The \code{UBMIObject} class is designed to store comprehensive results from the UBMI analysis, providing an integrated view of multi-omics data.
It allows for easy access to both combined and individual omics data results, facilitating further analysis and visualization.
